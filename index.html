    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I was born in New York City, I am a junior in Baruch college campus high school, and I am currently 15 years old. I have one brother who is older than me by 6 years. My favorite sports are volleyball and gymnastics. I have been playing volleyball for about 4 years, and I have been doing gymnastics for almost 10 years.</p>

    <div><p>Currently, I am in the Girls Who Code program that is located in Goldman Sachs. Throughout this experience, I have gotten the chance to learn about different types of code. In my high school, I do not have a lot of computer science classes, so I thought that this would be a good opportunity to get some computer science knowledge and experience.</p></div>
